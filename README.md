# Android POC

This **Android POC** was created as a tool to make experiments before start bringing AstroTV to the top of the Android layer.

Our goal for 2020 is to have AstroTV Shared Library for Android built using Android NDK and integrating this Shared Library with GloboPlay APK.

We started using 'android-ndk-r20' and we plan to make our first release on Android Q 10 API Level 29.


## Android-NDK-Projects

These projects use 'Android-NDK/android-ndk-r20/' infrastructure and their construction uses 'ndk-build'.


## android-studio-projects
